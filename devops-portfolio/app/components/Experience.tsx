    "Built a Full CI/CD Pipeline: I created an automated pipeline using GitHub Actions that took care of everything from building and testing the code to deploying it. This meant fewer manual steps and a lot more time saved for everyone involved.",
    "Infrastructure as Code: Using Terraform, I provisioned infrastructure on AWS. I set up VPCs and ECS clusters and ensured everything was reusable, scalable, and organized for staging and production environments.",
    "Cloud Deployments on AWS ECS Fargate Spot: Deployed containerized applications to AWS ECS Fargate Spot, which not only ensured smooth performance but also significantly cut down costsâ€”always a win!",
    "Containerization: Containerized the apps with Docker, created optimized images, and managed them on Docker Hub for easy access and deployment."
